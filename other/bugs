Stomping on diagonal surfice sometimes would cause a glitch in collision detection and move the character
through the ground.

Sometimes the game would become unresponsive and would either go to the main screen or stay frozen.

The movement controls behave weird from time to time and the character would move very slow.

When using jetpack and movement controls at the same time, releasing the movement controls would cause the jetpack
to stop until the jetpack button is pressed again.
